	I was reading the book 'Pro Git' and messing around in the git on terminal and something happened. It was not pushing through and also the file vanished. I copied it back, did the push again but the same error, it was saying merge was behind. So, I quit. After then the error happened again and I did the whole process again and <i>voila</i> it was solved. Thank goodness!

	Completed some basic introduction and history regarding HTML. In the most basic sense, HTML is a structure of the webpage, CSS is the styling, and Javascript is the function of the webpage. There are different forms of content which I'm going to look into. The main are block content or flow content and inline content or phase content. The latter is how it's known today and both are mostly similar.

	Completed the module 1 today, I'm thinking of going through the basic codes tomorrow morning and complete the quiz. A lot of new things to learn. Lists: ordered &amp; unordered. You can even have list within a list. How important the semantic tags are, probably in SEO. I'm going to mention all the entities used in the lecture:
	<ul>
		<li>ampersand sign : <code>&amp;amp;</code></li>
		<li>Greater than sign : <code>&amp;gt;</code></li>
		<li>Less than sign : <code>&amp;lt;</code></li>
		<li>Copyright symbol : <code>&amp;copy;</code></li>
		<li>No break space (to connect words with space) : <code>&amp;nbsp;</code></li>
		<li>Quotation symbol : <code>&amp;quot;</code></li>
	</ul> 
	I learned about links as well; external, internal and bookmarks. How to target your link to another page so that the user doesn't leave your website. Display image and also to specify the size of the image.

	I've been learning all about git and vim editor. Currently, I learned a lot about the push command through which I will be able to push an existing directory from the local content to github. I'm going to specify all the steps right here:

<pre><code>cd 'directory_location'
git init
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git remote add origin "url-from-github-repository"
git push -u origin master</code></pre>

		Now, if the repository at github has some files already in it like the README.md file, you need to pull the file first in the local content and then push all the files to the repository.

<pre><code>git pull origin master -allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin master</code></pre>

    I've also learned about the vim editor, atleast a few basic things. Using <code>touch</code> tag to create a gitignore file and then <code>vim</code> to access the vim editor. Pressing i to enter into insert mode and esc key to get back into the command mode. All commands are started with : and saving &amp; exiting is done with :wq [return key]. Thats it for today. I will be reading more about git tomorrow and probably give the test for the first module.

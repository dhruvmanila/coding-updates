  	I completely burned myself out today on my <a href="https://dhruvmanila.github.io/course-assignments/module2-solution/index.html">assignment</a> which, now that I look back, wasn't that difficult at all. I was stuck at one point where I was not able to get the sections in line with one other and they were just not aligning. I looked around, found a lot of basic HTML structure guides, looked through CSS guides and at the end I did find it, but I found a lot of other things as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I learned about the semantic structure of HTML, how these content tags such as <code class="sm_code">article</code>, <code class="sm_code">section</code>, <code class="sm_code">headings</code>, <code class="sm_code">header</code>, <code class="sm_code">footer</code>, <code class="sm_code">nav</code> and the last one which isn't technically a content tag <code class="sm_code">div</code> I'm understanding the structure of a webpage through these tags and I would never look at webpages the same way. I've been understanding the responsive design and the box model back again and that is a crucial element in CSS. All websites can be divided into boxes and sections and the above tags are given to each part accordingly giving the page a structure.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Now, that I've completed my assignment I will shift my focus on the process of learning and try to develop some ways to put all the knowledge efficiently and comprehensively in my mind. I am having a few ideas already such as using index cards for individual tags, project based learning which I mentioned in a <a href="21-6-2020.html">previous update</a> and also try as much as possible to not get into the rabbit hole of keep trying hard on the problem. Relax. Take a walk or nap. Go outside. Talk. Do other activities and the solution might just pop up when you get back.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I also get excited about litte things while coding and just try it. Oh, trying. Yes, I try a <em>lot</em> and by that I mean really a <em>lot.</em> You see what I'm doing, I'm putting an <code class="sm_code">em</code> tag around it. Getting the semantics right. It might be hours and hours and I keep trying every possible thing which comes into my mind and the best part is that it's so easy to test because the feedbacks are instant. So, you get an idea, you write the code for it and test it, instant feedback, it's either working or it's not, there's no spectrum here, it's just pure black and white. Sometimes and for me most of the times it might just be that I'm doing some sort of shortcut without realizing it and making the code complicated and that's why I go back and look at the code again after a while and clean it up.
  </p>
  <p>
  	I do look at <a href="https://sivers.org" target="_blank">Derek Sivers website</a> a lot for inspiration because his site is so simple and yet all the basics are present. You can see it on this site as well. So, he posted an article about <a href="https://sivers.org/learn-js" target="_blank">how to learn Javascript</a> and that led me into the rabbit hole of all the free materials out there for learning HTML, CSS and Javascript and other languages as well. Everything for <em>FREE</em>. I'm emphasizing a lot on this post, go look it up in the source code. Lets list a few of them and we'll call it a day.
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp</a> and it's <em>FREE.</em> That's the last time.</li>
  	<li><a href="https://htmldog.com"  target="_blank">HTML dog</a>. Now, I want a dog.</li>
  	<li>Learning to code by playing <a href="https://codepip.com" target="_blank">games</a>? Count me in.</li>
  	<li><a href="http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/" target="_blank">Javascrip garden</a>. Yeah, an online garden.</li>
  	<li>Where shall we have dinner? <a href="http://flukeout.github.io" target="_blank">CSS Diner</a> got us covered!</li>

  <p class="quote">It's <a href="https://medium.com/@noahmadden/navalism-quotes-perceptions-by-naval-ravikant-a5fd60ac5788" target="_blank">true</a> that the resources for learning are abundant in this age of internet, the only scarce thing is the desire to learn. Never let it extinguish. Keep your fire burning. Goodnight.</p>

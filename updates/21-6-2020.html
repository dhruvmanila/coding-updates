      So, today I completed the test of module 1 and it turned out to be the exact same questions as the practice ones. I thought it would be a little tough, but it turned out to be extremely easy. Yes, this is a beginner's course. I also learned more <code class="sm_code">git</code> commands such as looking at the log, finding out specific commit, changing remote names; it turned out that origin is the name given to the git repository so that I don't have to keep entering the repository link.

      I started <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> and it's like magic. If <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is the structure of the webpage, then CSS is the decoration you put in it. If HTML is the rooms, parition, floors, columns and beams of a building then CSS is the wall color, furniture, carpets, ceiling, plants, paintings, lights, etc. I'm going to take up two projects (in no order):
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm going to make a home page for my commonplacenotes website.</li>
        <li>The other is that I will take on the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a> project of decorating a given HTML file. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      And the last thing is I started the <cite>HTML &amp; CSS - Design and Build Websites</cite> book by Jon Duckett and there are lots of tags for HTML which I learned today. I really like the <code class="sm_code">form</code> chapter. I will be going through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools</a> website as well for learning more. That's it for now, maybe at night I will do some more coding. It's actually a lot more fun to code.

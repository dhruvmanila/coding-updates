    I think I'm just brushing past these videos on the course, it feels like the videos aren't helping me that much. The course is great, it's just I prefer more practical, so it feels like I just want to get this over with. Let's just look at the videos at my own pace and build other systems for learning tags and understanding. I have an idea for index cards; I will convert my old empty books into an index books where one side will be the code or topic or a word and on the other side will be the explanation or the answer. It's exactly like an index cards except I can carry hundreds of them like a folder. Pretty neat, huh.

    I also think instead of these daily updates it would be better to do weekly or monthly updates. I don't feel like writing much today. I think I would stick with weekly or monthly posts, it could be detailed notes.

	A lot of things learned and tried on today. Right now I did a lot of editing on this very page which are changing pages for each update, linking, adding CSS stylesheet, adjusting the site for the mobile browser, adding the 'go back' button (which I'll probably remove) and changing the entire website to night mode. By night mode I just changed the <code class="sm_code">background-color</code> and <code class="sm_code">color</code> property. Also, rearranged the files and folders for the website and I will use this just for updating.
</p>
<p>
	Now, I completed the module 2 from the course and was introduced to a wide variety of topics. Twitter bootstrap framework: It's kinda just like how a bootstrap would work which is that they provide the base CSS and Javascript file and you build your website on that foundation, just like how in a bootstrap you would build something from an existing things. I learned a lot about CSS selector position, how it works in hierarchy and how it can cancel out if same property is used.
</p>
<p>
	The bootstrap works according to the division of 12 columns and combining the number of columns in an equal way so that you can change the look of the webpage according to the screen size. 
</p>
<p>
	These three concepts are, for me, the most important concepts introduced today, atleast for now, which are float, relative and absolute postition. How you can use these property to position your block in different parts of the website and then using <code class="sm_code">@media</code> tag to adjust the block sizes and attributes according to different screen size which include mobile phones, tablets and computer screen. Here, the twitter bootstrap can help a lot so that you don't have to think everything for all the screen sizes. That said, I do want to understand how you can change for different screen sizes and not completely rely on an external solution. 
</p>
<p>
	One more important concept is the box model. Basically the websites are divided into boxes which you can control using different CSS properties and change the outlook for each box differently. 
</p>
<p>
	I didn't do anything related to git, although I wanted to change the name of the current repository, therefore changing the link to this site. Neither I read any further in the other book related to CSS. For a few days I will just be practing a lot of HTML and CSS. 
</p>
<p>	
	At the end of the day I tried to solve this issue where I added some CSS for code block and it was extending off the screen on mobile devices. Oh, I remember that I also learned to use browser to see how the code would look on mobile and other devices, which property to change, ability to change it on the browser itself and a lot more through the developer tools on Safari and Chrome. Back to code block issue, so I tried a lot of googling and looking at the code of other websites and by the way, this helps a ton, looking at other's source code and ticking off and on different attributes to see what actually happens, then finally I found a property which I used to get that fixed; <code class="sm_code">word-break: break-word</code> and <i>voila</i> everything was fixed and I started writing this. Thats it for today, see you next time.

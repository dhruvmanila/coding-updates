        - &ldquo;This is going to be a fun ride learning the basics of coding. I'm excited!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A static website used to keep myself accountable on my journey to coding. It is just going to be plain and simple because it's going to be just for updating what I learned about coding and related things everyday, atleast I hope it is everyday. It might be that sometimes I didn't learn or code much, but I will try to do it every single day because consistency matters in acquiring new skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of my journey, I am mostly not detailing enough of what I learned throught the day, but as I move forward, my writing and coding both will improve. I will try to be as much detailed as possible. UPDATES will be listed in reverse chronological order and I will try to write a brief summary of what I learned on that particular day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Update: I'm thinking of doing weekly or monthly updates as opposed to daily ones. Not finalized though.

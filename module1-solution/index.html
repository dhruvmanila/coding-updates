	This is going to be a fun ride learning the basics of coding. I'm excited!

	<b>UPDATE [12:10]</b> - I was reading the book 'Pro Git' and messing around in the git on terminal and something happened. It was not pushing through and also the file vanished. I copied it back, did the push again but the same error, it was saying merge was behind. So, I quit. After then the error happened again and I did the whole process again and <i>voila</i> it was solved. Thank goodness!

	<b>UPDATE [14:58]</b> - Completed some basic introduction and history regarding HTML. In the most basic sense, HTML is a structure of the webpage, CSS is the styling, and Javascript is the function of the webpage. There are different forms of content which I'm going to look into. The main are block content or flow content and inline content or phase content. The latter is how it's known today and both are mostly similar.

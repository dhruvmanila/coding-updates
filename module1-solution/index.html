<h1>Learning to Code</h1>
<i>Dhruv Manilawala</i>
<hr>
<p>
	This is going to be a fun ride learning the basics of coding. I'm excited!
</p>
<p>
	<b>UPDATE [12:10]</b> - I was reading the book 'Pro Git' and messing around in the git on terminal and something happened. It was not pushing through and also the file vanished. I copied it back, did the push again but the same error, it was saying merge was behind. So, I quit. After then the error happened again and I did the whole process again and <i>voila</i> it was solved. Thank goodness!
</p>
<p>
	<b>UPDATE [14:58]</b> - Completed some basic introduction and history regarding HTML. In the most basic sense, HTML is a structure of the webpage, CSS is the styling, and Javascript is the function of the webpage. There are different forms of content which I'm going to look into. The main are block content or flow content and inline content or phase content. The latter is how it's known today and both are mostly similar.
</p>
<p>
	<b>UPDATE [19:38]</b> - Completed the module 1 today, I'm thinking of going through the basic codes tomorrow morning and complete the quiz. A lot of new things to learn. Lists: ordered &amp; unordered. You can even have list within a list. How important the semantic tags are, probably in SEO. 
	<br>
	I'm going to mention all the entities used in the lecture:
	<ul>
		<li>ampersand sign : &amp;</li>
		<li>Greater than sign : &gt;</li>
		<li>Less than sign : &lt;</li>
		<li>Copyright symbol : &copy;</li>
		<li>No break space (to connect words with space) : &nbsp;</li>
		<li>Quotation symbol : &quot;</li>
	</ul> 
	I learned about links as well; external, internal and bookmarks. How to target your link to another page so that the user doesn't leave your website. Display image and also to specify the size of the image.

	This is going to be a fun ride learning the basics of coding. I'm excited!

	UPDATE [12:10] - I was reading the book 'Pro Git' and messing around in the git on terminal and something happened. It was not pushing through and also the file vanished. I copied it back, did the push again but the same error, it was saying merge was behind. So, I quit. After then the error happened again and I did the whole process again and <i>voila</i> it was solved. Thank goodness!
